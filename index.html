                     "I stumbled across this sustainable community in Costa Rica while obsessively looking through images of treehouses online.  I fell in love immediately.  
                     Finca Bellavista is a treehouse community not far from Golfito, Costa Rica.  Their focus is primarily on stopping further deforestation on this particular part of the land
                     and leaving the smallest environmental footprint as possible.  Also, who doesn't want to stay in a treehouse in the rainforest for a week?"

                <p>
                    "Flying from San Jose, Costa Rica to Golfito was peaceful, unique, and terrifying.  If you've never flown on a Cessna, it's something you should try at least once in your life.  
                    There route straddles the coast and the mountains and is nothing short of scenic the entire flight.  The terrifying aspect of the flight came right before landing, I could feel the plane 
                    descending but I did not see a runway.  As we got lower to the ground my fiance and I saw one paved strip (the runway) and at the very end a line of trees, we didn't seem to be slowing down fast enough 
                    and our reaction to sheer panic was to laugh hysterically.  The airport itself was all outdoors, so your transportation can pick you up right from the end of the runway.  
                    Our transportation was an old all-wheel drive SUV which was necessary due to the terrain on the way to Finca Bellavista.  By the time we made it to our destination, we thought we'd check in and make the short trel 
                    to our treehouse, it turns out I ignored a very important detail.  We were in the rainforest, sure, but the website stated a 25 minute <i>hike</i> to our house, and I apparently have a much different opinion of what 
                    a hike is.  You must wear rainboots at all times outdoors because there are snakes, the main path is not paved but it is covered in loose rocks, some of which are very large, and since it is the rainforest... well, it rains 
                    which causes the hike to be treacherous if you're as out of shape as I was during this trip.  The icing on the cake was once our guides, my fiance Charles, and myself had finally reached the base of our treehouse, I saw stairs.  
                    Of course these were not ordinary stairs, they were man-made by using wood planks to push back the mud, and some of them were tall enough that I had to hike my leg up to rwach them.  One of the nights I actually counted each 
                    step, there were about 200 of them.  Reaching the very top and seeing the treehouse for the first time put me in awe of nature, it was truly serene and breathtaking.  We wanted a nice relaxing vacation, far away from the modern world 
                    with no electricity, no cell phones, no internet, no social media, and no interruptions, and we got exactly that.
