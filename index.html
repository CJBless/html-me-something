                <h2>A little background</h2>
                <p>
                     I stumbled across this sustainable community in Costa Rica while obsessively looking through images of treehouses online.  I fell in love immediately.  
                     Finca Bellavista is a treehouse community not far from Golfito, Costa Rica.  Their focus is primarily on stopping further deforestation on this particular part of the land
                     and leaving the smallest environmental footprint as possible.  Also, who doesn't want to stay in a treehouse in the rainforest for a week?

                <h2>Getting to Paradise</h2>
                <p>
                    Flying from San Jose, Costa Rica to Golfito was peaceful, unique, and terrifying.  If you've never flown on a Cessna, it's something you should try at least once in your life.  
                    There route straddles the coast and the mountains and is nothing short of scenic the entire flight.  The terrifying aspect of the flight came right before landing, I could feel the plane 
                    descending but I did not see a runway.  As we got lower to the ground my fiance&#769 and I saw one paved strip (the runway) and at the very end a line of trees, we didn't seem to be slowing down fast enough 
                    and our reaction to sheer panic was to laugh hysterically.  The airport itself was all outdoors, so your transportation can pick you up right from the end of the runway.  
                    Our transportation was an old all-wheel drive SUV which was necessary due to the terrain on the way to Finca Bellavista.  By the time we made it to our destination, we thought we'd check in and make the short trel 
                    to our treehouse, it turns out I ignored a very important detail.  We were in the rainforest, sure, but the website stated a 25 minute <i>hike</i> to our house, and I apparently have a much different opinion of what 
                    a hike is.  You must wear rainboots at all times outdoors because there are snakes, the main path is not paved but it is covered in loose rocks, some of which are very large, and since it is the rainforest... well, it rains 
                    which causes the hike to be treacherous if you're as out of shape as I was during this trip.  The icing on the cake was once our guides, my fiance&#769 Charles, and myself had finally reached the base of our treehouse, I saw stairs.  
                    Of course these were not ordinary stairs, they were man-made by using wood planks to push back the mud, and some of them were tall enough that I had to hike my leg up to rwach them.  One of the nights I actually counted each 
                    step, there were about 200 of them.  Reaching the very top and seeing the treehouse for the first time put me in awe of nature, it was truly serene and breathtaking.  We wanted a nice relaxing vacation, far away from the modern world 
                    with no electricity, no cell phones, no internet, no social media, and no interruptions, and we got exactly that.

                <h2>The Rest of Our Stay</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many things to be said about disconnecting from the world at large.  It was humid, and quiet, and rough.  My only wish is that Charles and I had been in better shape 
                    during our stay there.  We were 20+ minutes away from base camp, where all the meals are served.  Three times a day we walked back and forth from there, in between our times walking around 
                    the grounds and exploring.  They have their own garden, we paid for a produce bag and picked some fresh herbs in an attempt to leave the treehouse less.  The house was beautiful, and in the center where the 
                    tree came through, these tiny bats would fly up and sleep.  We saw the bats the first morning there, and I obsessed over them for the remainder of our stay, one of them hung out by the kitchen window under the roof.  My 
                    favorite part of the day was sitting on one of the balconies and just listening to the sounds around us while we ate.

                    We participated in exactly one activity while we were there which was ziplining, which I highly recommend, below is a short clip of Charles on one of the lines.

                    We spent most of our time walking around, there are other houses visible from the main path which 
                    are interesting to look at.  I passed the one below on the way home every day.  Other than the small river and a waterfall on the grounds, there are trails everywhere and sometimes you can see wildlife, though 
                    I mostly just saw spiders and bats.  We slept so peacefully there listening to the rain fall it was almost impossible to sleep when we got back to our real home.  Pictures simply can't do this experience any justice, 
                    it's unique and special especially for anyone who is used to a fast-paced way of life.
